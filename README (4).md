## Problem
In this hackathon, the goal is to create a machine learning model that extracts entity values from images. This capability is crucial in fields like healthcare, e-commerce, and content moderation, where precise product information is vital. As digital marketplaces expand, many products lack detailed textual descriptions, making it essential to obtain key details directly from images. These images provide important information such as weight, volume, voltage, wattage, dimensions, and many more, which are critical for digital stores.

## Data Description

The dataset consists of the following columns:</br>

index: A unique identifier (ID) for the data sample.</br>
image_link: Public URL where the product image is available for download. </br>
Example link - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XfHPR36-L.jpg</br> 
To download images, use the download_images function from src/utils.py.</br>
 See sample code in src/test.ipynb.</br>
group_id: Category code of the product.</br>
entity_name: Product entity name. For example, ‚Äúitem_weight‚Äù.</br>
entity_value: Product entity value. For example, ‚Äú34 gram‚Äù.</br>
Note: For test.csv, you will not see the column entity_value as it is the target variable.</br>
